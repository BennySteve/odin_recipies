<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>    Bring 5-6 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Add chow mein noodles to the boiling water along with a teaspoon of salt and a few drops of oil. Boil as per packet instructions or for 3-4 minutes until almost cooked. Then drain the hot water and transfer the noodles to a bowl of cold water. Drain and set aside until ready to use.

    <li>In the meantime, prepare all the vegetables. Coarsely chop the garlic. Thinly slice the onions, carrots, cabbage and colored bell peppers. The cooking time of vegetables for making chowmein is very less, so you need to keep everything ready before you start cooking.
    1 Medium Sized Onion, 1 Carrot, 1 Cup Shredded Cabbage, 3-4 Cloves Garlic, 1 Cup Sliced Colored Bell Peppers</li>

    <li>Heat some oil in a wok or large deep pan. When the oil is hot, add garlic and stir for a couple of seconds. It shouldn't turn brown, otherwise it may lead to slightly bitter taste.</li>

    <li>Immediately add the sliced onions and cook for 1-2 minutes until the onions start browning very slightly.</li>

    <li>Then add the sliced carrots and cabbage. Sauté on high flame for a minute.</li>

    <li>Add the colored bell peppers. When making chow mein, all the vegetables need to be cooked on high heat for a short period of time till they are cooked but still crunchy to the bite.</li>

    <li>Now add some soy sauce, green chilli sauce, tomato ketchup, sugar, salt and black pepper powder to the wok. Stir to mix the sauce and spices with the vegetables. Chowmein generally has a slight twinge of sweetness, but if you don’t like the sweet taste, you can skip adding sugar and tomato ketchup.
    2 Tablespoons Soy Sauce, 1 Tablespoon Green Chilli Sauce, 1/2 Tablespoon Tomato Ketchup, 1/2 Teaspoon Sugar, 1 Teaspoon Salt or to taste, 1 Teaspoon Black Pepper Powder</li>

    <li>Add the boiled noodles to the wok. Mix with the help of 2 ladles or forks to coat them completely in the sauces.</li>

    <li>Cook for a couple of minutes on high flame till the noodles are completely cooked.</li>
    </ol>
